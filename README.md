This project is part of the [SCORE Network](https://scorenetwork.org). The SCORE Network's aim is to create interactive modules that teach students statistics using data from sports.
This project is the rough draft of one such module that I wrote during the Summer of 2023.
This module explains the statistical concept of k-means clustering using data from NBA Players in the 2021-2022 season.
The module visualizes the concept of similarity using euclidean distance; introduces the concept of clustering; and the method of selecting the number of clusters.
The report analyzes and compares the players within each cluster, and allows the user to make hypothetical offseason decisions using the clusters.
